## Experience

Currently I’m an AI/ML Engineer at Headspace AI Labs, focused on AI safety and building conversational agents.

A few highlights about myself:
* I hold a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Northwestern University and an M.S. in Applied Statistics from UCLA.
* During my time at UCLA, my thesis focused on improving MRI-based Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis by generating synthetic neuroimaging data using Dall-E-2 and evaluating downstream image classification performance gains to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). The work centered on data augmentation, distributional fidelity, and performance gains in low-sample clinical settings.

When I’m not working, I enjoy being outdoors — running, traveling, or occasionally pretending I know how to fish. I also dabble in photography when the lighting (and my timing) cooperate. Check out my photography [here](https://www.google.com).
