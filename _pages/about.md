Currently, I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com), where I build and deploy conversational agents and safety systems for digital mental health applications. My work centers on AI safety and building agentic conversational workflows in the form of [Ebb](https://www.headspace.com/ai-mental-health-companion), Headspace's empathetic AI companion.

A few highlights about myself:
* I hold a B.S. in Industrial Engineering from Northwestern University and an M.S. in Applied Statistics from UCLA.
* During my time at UCLA, my thesis focused on improving MRI-based Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis by generating synthetic neuroimaging data using Dall-E-2 and evaluating downstream image classification performance gains to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). The work centered on data augmentation, distributional fidelity, and performance gains in low-sample clinical settings.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending [time outdoors](https://www.strava.com/athletes/29879618), [taking photos](https://www.google.com), and drinking coffee in diners.
