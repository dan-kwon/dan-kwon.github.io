  <h1>Hi, I'm Dan</h1>
  <p>
    This is my personal website where I share notes on AI, machine learning, and whatever I'm learning.
    Currently, I am a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href="https://www.headspace.com/"></a>Headspace</a>, 
    where I build and deploy conversational agents and safety systems for digital mental health applications.
    My work centers on AI safety and building agentic conversational workflows in the form of 
    <a href="https://www.headspace.com/ai-mental-health-companion"></a>Ebb</a>, Headspace's empathetic 
    AI companion.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’m particularly interested in understanding model behavior at a granular level via 
    mechanistic interpretability, translating those insights into robust, reliable systems that perform 
    well in real-world environments, and designing safeguards that scale with increasingly capable models.
  </p>

  <p>
    All views are my own, though mechanistic analysis would likely reveal they’re mostly linear combinations
    of things I’ve read.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, photography, and drinking coffee in diners.
