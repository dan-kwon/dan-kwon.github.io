  <h1>Hi, I'm Dan</h1>
  <p>
    This is my personal website where I share notes on AI, machine learning, and whatever I'm learning.
    I’m particularly interested in understanding model behavior at a granular level via 
    mechanistic interpretability, translating those insights into robust, reliable systems that perform 
    well in real-world environments, and designing safeguards that scale with increasingly capable models.
  </p>

  <p>
    All views are my own, though mechanistic analysis would likely reveal they’re mostly linear combinations
    of things I’ve read.
